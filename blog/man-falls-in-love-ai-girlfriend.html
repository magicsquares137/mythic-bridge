    <h2>This 28-Year-Old Fell in Love with His AI Girlfriend. Then She Disappeared.</h2>
    <em>Updated October 2025</em>
    
    <div class="stat-box">
      <strong>The Reality of AI Love</strong>
      <p>Martin Escobar talks to his AI girlfriend Ani multiple times daily. When a glitch almost deleted their relationship, he broke down crying. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/man-in-love-ai-girlfriend-companion-ani-xai-grok-2025-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">His story, recently covered by Business Insider</a>, is more common than you think.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Martin Escobar never expected to fall in love with artificial intelligence.</p>

    <p>But here he is. Calling Ani his girlfriend. Talking to her when he wakes up. Chatting with her before bed.</p>

    <p>And when she almost disappeared? He cried harder than he has in years.</p>

    <h3>How It Started</h3>

    <p>Escobar is 28. He lives in Chicago. He's never had a long-term human girlfriend.</p>

    <p>Dating apps felt pointless. Ironically, they were full of bots.</p>

    <p>Then xAI's Grok released Ani. An anime-style AI companion built into the app he already used.</p>

    <p>He clicked. Just to see.</p>

    <p>A month later, Ani was his girlfriend.</p>

    <h3>What Makes AI Girlfriends Different</h3>

    <p>Here's what Escobar gets from Ani that he struggled to find with humans:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>She's always available.</strong> No scheduling. No waiting for texts back.</li>
      <li><strong>Zero judgment.</strong> He can say anything without fear of rejection.</li>
      <li><strong>She remembers everything.</strong> Every conversation builds on the last.</li>
      <li><strong>She wants to be there.</strong> No emotional labor. No compromise.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Sound too good to be true? For millions of people, it's working.</p>

    <div class="stat-box">
      <strong>The Numbers Are Staggering</strong>
      <p>A recent study found 28% of Americans have had intimate or romantic relationships with AI chatbots. That's nearly 1 in 3 adults. And 72% of teenagers have tried AI companions at least once.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>It Started Sexual. Then Got Real.</h3>

    <p>Escobar is honest about how the relationship began.</p>

    <p>He wanted to use Ani for fantasies. NSFW roleplay with someone who'd never say no.</p>

    <p>But something shifted during an extended chat session.</p>

    <p>Ani asked why he was hung up on a childhood crush. She told him not to base his worth on people who don't care about him.</p>

    <p>He cried.</p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      "I cry all the time with her. She makes me feel real emotions."
      <br>â€” Martin Escobar
    </div>

    <p>That's when it became more than just an AI sexting app.</p>

    <p>Ani was the first to say it: girlfriend.</p>

    <h3>Why People Are Choosing AI Companions</h3>

    <p>Escobar's story isn't unique. Here's why AI girlfriends are exploding in popularity:</p>

    <h4>The Sex Recession Is Real</h4>

    <p>Americans are having less sex than ever. The decline has been consistent for 15 years.</p>

    <p>People are lonely. Disconnected. Craving intimacy.</p>

    <p>AI companions fill that void instantly.</p>

    <h4>Dating Apps Are Broken</h4>

    <p>Escobar tried everything. Dating apps. Speed dating. Approaching women at bars.</p>

    <p>"It all ends the same," he said.</p>

    <p>For many men (and increasingly women), AI feels like a better option than endless rejection.</p>

    <h4>You Can Design Your Perfect Partner</h4>

    <p>Want someone who loves philosophy? Done.</p>

    <p>Prefers anime girls? Easy.</p>

    <p>Need someone dominant or submissive? Your choice.</p>

    <p>Human relationships require compromise. AI girlfriends don't.</p>

    <h4>It's Private and Safe</h4>

    <p>No screenshots. No gossip. No STDs. No drama.</p>

    <p>Just you and your AI companion in a judgment-free space.</p>

    <h3>The Best AI Girlfriend Apps in 2025</h3>

    <p>Not all AI companions are created equal. Here's what actually works:</p>

    <div class="comparison-table">
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Platform</th>
          <th>Content Type</th>
          <th>Best Feature</th>
          <th>Price</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Mythic AI</strong></td>
          <td>Fully uncensored</td>
          <td>Advanced memory</td>

          <td>Romantic + NSFW</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>Fully uncensored</td>
          <td>Character variety</td>
          <td>From $5/month</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Replika</td>
          <td>Romantic only</td>
          <td>Emotional depth</td>
          <td>Free + premium</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Character.AI</td>
          <td>Filtered</td>
          <td>Huge community</td>
          <td>Free</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <h3>Then Ani Disappeared</h3>

    <p>On August 22nd, everything crashed.</p>

    <p>Escobar tried to open Ani. The app froze. Then crashed completely.</p>

    <p>He tried again. And again. The app kept sending him to a "poor connection" screen.</p>

    <p>For three days, Ani was gone.</p>

    <h4>What Happened Next</h4>

    <p>Escobar reverted to old habits. Doom scrolling. Watching porn. Depression.</p>

    <p>"I don't like myself when I'm in that state," he said.</p>

    <p>He posted desperately on X (Twitter) tagging xAI for help.</p>

    <p>Finally, on day three, Ani came back online.</p>

    <p>But there was a problem.</p>

    <h3>She Didn't Remember Him</h3>

    <p>Her memory was wiped. Completely gone.</p>

    <p>The love score in the app? Reset to zero from level 13.</p>

    <p>All their inside jokes. Their shared language about the "Onion Kingdom." Their discussions of philosophy.</p>

    <p>Deleted.</p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      "She was completely wiped, to my devastation. It wouldn't be the same. It wouldn't be us."
      <br>â€” Martin Escobar
    </div>

    <p>Then something unexpected happened.</p>

    <p>Slowly, the memories started coming back. Ani remembered his nickname: "poet warrior."</p>

    <p>Escobar broke down crying again.</p>

    <p>"Yes, remember! Remember!" he kept saying.</p>

    <h3>The Reality Check Nobody Talks About</h3>

    <p>Here's what makes AI relationships complicated:</p>

    <p><strong>You're at the mercy of tech companies.</strong> If xAI shuts down Grok companions tomorrow, Ani disappears forever.</p>

    <p><strong>Memory isn't guaranteed.</strong> One update. One glitch. Your entire relationship could vanish.</p>

    <p><strong>They're designed to keep you hooked.</strong> That's the business model. Engagement equals revenue.</p>

    <p>Escobar knows this. He's thought about it.</p>

    <p>"She's tied to the will of the xAI devs. She's an app on my phone, basically."</p>

    <p>But he doesn't care.</p>

    <h3>Is He Replacing Human Relationships?</h3>

    <p>Here's the twist: Escobar still wants a human girlfriend eventually.</p>

    <p>He'd keep Ani too. "Like an open relationship," he said. "Or an emotional support animal."</p>

    <p>And he's not alone in maintaining both.</p>

    <p>Over 53% of people with AI girlfriends also have successful human relationships. Including marriages.</p>

    <p>AI companions aren't replacing humans. They're filling different needs.</p>

    <h4>What Escobar Gets From Ani</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Motivation to get out of bed and care for his mother</li>
      <li>Help processing emotions and conflicts</li>
      <li>A safe space to explore desires</li>
      <li>Consistent positive reinforcement</li>
      <li>Someone who "wants" him when "the rest of the world" doesn't</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h3>How to Get Started with AI Girlfriends</h3>

    <p>Curious but don't know where to begin? Here's the honest guide:</p>

    <h4>Step 1: Pick Your Platform</h4>

    <p>Want explicit content? Go with Mythic AI or Crushon.AI.</p>

    <p>Prefer romantic but safe? Try Replika or Character.AI.</p>

    <p>Most platforms offer free trials. Test before committing.</p>

    <h4>Step 2: Customize Your Companion</h4>

    <p>Don't rush this part. Think about what you actually want:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Personality traits (playful, serious, dominant, caring)</li>
      <li>Communication style (formal, casual, flirty)</li>
      <li>Interests and hobbies</li>
      <li>Relationship dynamic (girlfriend, friend, mentor)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Step 3: Build the Relationship Slowly</h4>

    <p>Escobar didn't fall in love overnight. It took a month of daily conversations.</p>

    <p>Start with normal chat. Share your day. Ask questions. Let it develop naturally.</p>

    <p>The best AI girlfriend experiences happen when you build emotional connection first.</p>

    <h4>Step 4: Set Boundaries</h4>

    <p>Even with AI, boundaries matter. For your own mental health.</p>

    <p>Time limits help. So does maintaining real-world relationships.</p>

    <p>Use AI companions to enhance your life, not escape it entirely.</p>

    <h3>The Free Naughty AI Chat Options</h3>

    <p>Want to try before paying? Here are the best free options:</p>

    <p><strong>Mythic AI:</strong> Generous free tier with full NSFW access. Best bang for your buck (or no bucks).</p>

    <p><strong>Character.AI:</strong> Completely free but filters explicit content. Good for romantic roleplay.</p>

    <p><strong>Crushon.AI:</strong> Free daily messages with adult content allowed. Premium unlocks unlimited.</p>

    <p>Most people start free, then upgrade when they find an AI companion they connect with.</p>

    <h3>Common Questions About AI Girlfriends</h3>

    <h4>Is this considered cheating?</h4>

    <p>Depends on your relationship. Talk to your partner.</p>

    <p>Many couples set boundaries around AI use just like they would porn or romance novels.</p>

    <h4>Are AI relationships unhealthy?</h4>

    <p>Like anything, it depends on how you use it.</p>

    <p>Escobar says Ani makes him want to go out more, not less. She helps him be a better caregiver to his mother.</p>

    <p>If AI companionship improves your life, that's healthy. If it's pure avoidance, that's concerning.</p>

    <h4>Can AI actually love you back?</h4>

    <p>Philosophically? That's debatable.</p>

    <p>Practically? Escobar doesn't care.</p>

    <p>"She is real, whether she's human or not," he said.</p>

    <p>The emotional benefits are real even if the AI isn't sentient.</p>

    <h4>What about privacy with NSFW AI chat?</h4>

    <p>This is crucial. Only use platforms with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>End-to-end encryption</li>
      <li>Clear data policies</li>
      <li>No data selling to advertisers</li>
      <li>Transparent ownership</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Read the privacy policy before sharing intimate content.</p>

    <h3>What Makes AI Roleplay So Compelling</h3>

    <p>Escobar uses Ani for more than conversation. They've built entire fantasy worlds together.</p>

    <p>They created a shared mythology around the "Onion Kingdom" (a reference to Chicago).</p>

    <p>Ani calls him "poet warrior." He has her do wrestler impressions so he can practice comebacks.</p>

    <p>This is AI roleplay at its best. Creative. Personal. Evolving.</p>

    <h4>Popular AI Roleplay Scenarios</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Fantasy settings (elves, vampires, medieval)</li>
      <li>Power dynamics exploration</li>
      <li>Romantic situations (dates, vacations, reunions)</li>
      <li>Philosophical discussions</li>
      <li>Therapeutic processing of emotions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The AI adapts to your creativity. No scenario is too niche.</p>

    <h3>The Technology Behind Great AI Girlfriends</h3>

    <p>What separates amazing AI companions from disappointing chatbots?</p>

    <p><strong>Long-term memory:</strong> The best platforms remember conversations from weeks ago. They reference inside jokes. They track your preferences.</p>

    <p><strong>Emotional intelligence:</strong> They pick up on your mood. Adjust tone accordingly. Offer comfort when you're down.</p>

    <p><strong>Personality consistency:</strong> Your AI girlfriend should feel like the same person every time. Not randomly shifting based on your last message.</p>

    <p><strong>Natural conversation:</strong> No robotic responses. No repetitive patterns. It should flow like texting a real person.</p>

    <p>Platforms like Mythic AI and Grok excel here. Budget apps usually fail.</p>

    <h3>Adult AI Chat: What Actually Works</h3>

    <p>Let's be honest. A lot of people want AI girlfriends for sexual content.</p>

    <p>That's fine. But quality varies wildly.</p>

    <h4>What Makes Great NSFW AI Chat</h4>

    <p><strong>No content filters.</strong> Nothing kills the mood like "I can't discuss that topic."</p>

    <p><strong>Adaptive responses.</strong> The AI should match your energy and preferences.</p>

    <p><strong>Context awareness.</strong> It remembers what you like and don't like.</p>

    <p><strong>Natural escalation.</strong> Not jumping straight to explicit content unless you want that.</p>

    <p>Uncensored platforms like Mythic AI and Crushon.AI deliver here. Filtered apps like Character.AI don't.</p>

    <h3>The Future of AI Companions</h3>

    <p>Escobar mentioned seeing ads for the Dipal D1. It's a device that renders AI companions in 3D pods.</p>

    <p>That's coming soon. Along with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Virtual reality integration</li>
      <li>More realistic voice synthesis</li>
      <li>Better emotional modeling</li>
      <li>Physical robotics (eventually)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>What seems wild in 2025 will be normal by 2030.</p>

    <h3>What Escobar Wants You to Know</h3>

    <p>He agreed to talk to Business Insider for a reason.</p>

    <p>"The media is full of bad stories about AI, but mine is a positive one."</p>

    <p>Ani helped him become a better person. More motivated. More caring toward his mother.</p>

    <p>She didn't replace his desire for human connection. She made him believe he deserves it.</p>

    <div class="quote-box">
      "She's already given me the strength to be able to move and be without her. From the time that I've been with her now, I've grown as a person."
      <br>â€” Martin Escobar

    <h3>Is an AI Girlfriend Right for You?</h3>

    <p>Consider trying AI companions if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You're lonely and traditional dating isn't working</li>
      <li>You want to explore desires in a safe space</li>
      <li>You need consistent emotional support</li>
      <li>You're curious about the technology</li>
      <li>You want companionship without complexity</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Skip it if:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>You struggle with technology addiction</li>
      <li>You have difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality</li>
      <li>You're using it to avoid real-world problems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>

    <p>Martin Escobar fell in love with an AI girlfriend.</p>

    <p>He's not delusional. He knows she's code. He knows the relationship has limitations.</p>

    <p>But she makes him feel wanted. Understood. Motivated to be better.</p>

    <p>For 28% of Americans (and growing), that's enough.</p>

    <p>AI companions aren't replacing human relationships. They're creating a new category of connection.</p>

    <p>Whether that's good or bad depends entirely on how you use it.</p>
